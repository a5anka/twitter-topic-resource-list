# Twitter Resource List Generator

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to generate a popular resource list for 
a topic in Twitter.

### How it works

The application uses the Twitter API to get the recent tweets matching a topic. 
Following is the rough steps the application goes through to fulfill the user 
requirement. 

1. The created front end will read the user input and submit it to the backend 
written purely using [Ballerina](https://ballerinalang.org/). 
2. The backend will then query the twitter API with the given query. The 
application uses the configured bearer token to authorize with the twitter API. 
Therefore make sure a valid bearer token is used. 
3. Front end expects the results in JSON format as an array of urls and scores. 
Here score is used to rank the returned results. Higher the value of the rank the more 
popular the resources. Currentlyi, the score is just the sum of the retweet count 
and the favourite count. In a future version, a complex ranking function can be 
implemented. The Ballerina script will transform the message returned from the 
Twitter API to the format expected by the frontend and send the JSON response.
4. After receiving the AJAX response, the front-end will populate the list sorted 
according to the score value of the urls.
5. If you use a new query and click "Reload data" button process will go from 
steps 1 to 4.  

## Use case

This application is very useful if you want to quickly generate a list of trending 
news/blog articles for a given topic. Users will just have to provide the interested 
topic to the application and the application will generate a list of URLs sorted 
according to their popularity.

Since the application supports all the 
[operators supported by Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/71577),
users can generate a list resources from a specific user or organization or list of 
resources popular in a specific location etc. Additionally, Those lists will be 
sorted according to the ranking function. 

## Running the Application

1. Open the TwitterReadingListservice.bal file and change `BEARER_TOKEN` 
constant to match the bearer token you have. If You don't have a bearer 
token, you can read the twitter api reference on 
[Application-only authentication](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only) 
to get a bearer token.

2. Use the following command to run the backend service
 
```
$ ballerina run service TwitterReadingListservice.bal
```

3. Open the `index.html` file on a web browser to generate resource list for a topic.
